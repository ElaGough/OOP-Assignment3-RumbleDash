### The Lore

Open sky..... Questionable land planning… Yetis… This is Sunshine Valley. Home to the annual Rumble Dash, these adorable rural villagers live their lives in the hopes of one day competing in this prestigious tournament, to bring fame, glory, and purpose to their lives…. 
Cuties must compete to reach the flag before their opponent while avoiding treacherous objects, creatures and the tiny fury of their fellow competitor! Can you help these cuties rumble their way to victory? Be there, or be square! Coming March 2017 at Games Fleadh

### Goals

The objective is simple: reach the flag! Oh also do it before the timer runs out, don’t let your opponent kill you, avoid obstacles like the plague whilst always being super adorable… simple!

### Controls
   Player 1 - WASD    
   Player 2 - Arrow Keys


### Features we are most proud of…

   Manipulating the script camera follow the characters and expand and contract depending on the location of the players.    
   Original Graphics - All the graphics and animation you see on screen was drawn by us! Drawing Yetis isn't procrastination when it's for    a project...right?    
   Creative backstories - Each character has its own interesting and / or slightly tragic back story to bring them to life!    
   We implimented encapsulation by using the access specifiers public, private, and static. We did this by assigning game objects to public    variables in Unity.    
   Our use of array lists for the health bar which increases and decreases health as well as adding and removing hearts as a visual            indicator of the players health.               
   Buttons that acivate and deactivate game objects. This is used in the character selection scene.            
   Every script makes use of inheritence.
